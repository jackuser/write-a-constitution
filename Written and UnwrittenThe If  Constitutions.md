Constitutions take many different forms. They can be characterized on many dimensions. One of the most interesting involves whether or
not the constitution is written. Most constitutions are written, either as one document or as a set of related documents. A small
number of constitutions are unwritten. The most notable example is Great Britain. If a constitution is not formally written, then
there must be some generally recognized procedure by which the unwritten rules are designated as part of the constitutional apparatus
of the country.
